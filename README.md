# NOVAI - AI Companion Landing Page
## A clean, responsive landing page for an AI startup built with pure HTML & CSS
In this project i tried using flexbox as much as possible to create a responsive design, and used CSS to make simple animations when hovering over some objects.
By looking at the code you can see exactly how i did it!
